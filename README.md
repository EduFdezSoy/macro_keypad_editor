## Usage
As your usual Python3 project. Install dependencies in `requirements.txt` and run `index.py`.

## Dedpendencies
This project uses [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io) to make a cross-platform interface.  
It's nice and easy, would use again.

## Donations
If you really liked it and feel like I deserve some money, you can buy me a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/EduFdezSoy) and I'll continue transforming caffeine into code!
